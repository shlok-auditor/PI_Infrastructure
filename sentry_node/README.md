Project Name

This project demonstrates the integration of Sentry error monitoring with a Node.js application.

Description

This application showcases how to set up error monitoring and reporting using Sentry in a Node.js project. Sentry helps track and debug errors in real-time, enabling you to resolve issues quickly and improve the stability of your application.

Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- npm (version X.X.X or higher)
- A Sentry account (create one at https://sentry.io)

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   create a newproject

2. Change to the project's directory:

   cd project

3. Install the dependencies:

   npm install

4. Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:

   SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn

   Replace your_sentry_dsn with the actual DSN (Data Source Name) you obtain from your Sentry project settings.

Usage

1. Start the application:

   npm start

2. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

3. Trigger an error by performing actions that will cause exceptions to be thrown in the application.

4. Check your Sentry dashboard at https://sentry.io to see the reported errors and track their details.

Configuration

To configure additional options for the Sentry SDK, refer to the official documentation: Sentry for Node.js (https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/node/).

Code Integration

Below is an example of integrating Sentry in your Node.js application:

1. Install the Sentry package:

   npm install @sentry/node

2. Import the Sentry module and configure it with your DSN:

   const Sentry = require('@sentry/node');

   Sentry.init({
     dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN
   });

3. Add error capturing in your code:

   // Example code with an intentional error
   try {
     // Your code here
     throw new Error('This is a test error');
   } catch (error) {
     Sentry.captureException(error);
   }

   // You can also capture messages
   Sentry.captureMessage('This is a test message');

4. Run your Node.js application and verify that errors and messages are being reported to Sentry.
